## Yesod-based RESTful Calculator

I was tasked with building a RESTful Calculator web application with the Yesod framework. It supports basic calculator features (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and has data persistence.

### Download and run instructions

0. Install the Haskell Platform (i.e. GHC, cabal, and stack)
1. Clone repo into directory of choice via `https://github.com/petermcneil/yesod-calc.git`
2. Run the project with `stack build && stack exec yesod-calc`
   -- Note this may take a while if you have never run stack.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
